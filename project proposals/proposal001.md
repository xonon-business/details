# Proposal 001

Proposal 001 (doesn't have a name yet) is a cloud platform for small and medium start-ups with affodable pricing.

services that I have planned:
  - wave: wave is a cli to to instantly deploy your apps to you server or app engine instance.
  - app engine: is a node with a pre-built environmet for any web app from javascript to elixir without having to do any work and if you want manually add something you could ssh into it. 
  - actions: basicly firebase could functions, you build you functions and its run a docker container.
  - node: a docker container or virtial machine
